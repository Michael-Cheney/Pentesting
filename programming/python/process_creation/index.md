# Process Creation
## Forking
* Cloning of a process
* Forking creates an identical process as the parent
* The thread of execution is duplicated exactly at the point of call to fork()
  * Returns 0 in the child
  * Return pid the child in the parent
* Dedicate a child to a task given by the parent
* Parent and child can communicate if required using IPC
* Parent / child binary remains the same

### Example
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

import os

def child_process () :
    
    print "I am the child process and my PID is: %d"%os.getpid()

    print "The child is exiting"

def parent_process () : 

    print "I am the parent process with PID : %d"%os.getpid()

    childpid = os.fork()

    if childpid == 0 :
        # We are the child process
        child_process()
    
    else :
        # We are the parent process
        print "We are the parent process"
        print "Our child has the PID : %d"%childpid

    while True:
        pass

parent_process()
```

## Spawning new processes
* os.exec* functions
  * os.execl
  * os.execle
* Overlays parent process with the child

### Example
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

import os

os.execvp("ping", ["ping", "127.0.0.1"])
