# Threads
CPython implementation detail: Due to the Global interpreter Lock, in CPython only one thread can execute Python code at once (even though certain performance-oriented libraries might overcome this limitation). If you want your application to make better use of the computational resources of multi-core machines, yyou are advised to use multiprocessing. However, threading is still an appropriate model if you want to run multiple I/O-bound tasks simultaneously. 

* Apart from I/O Tasks such as Network reads, Writing to disk etc. Python Threads are not too useful. 
* Simple threads using the thread module
* More complicated ones using the threading module

## Example
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

import thread
import time

def worder_thread(id) :
    
    print "Thread ID %d now alive"%id
    count = 1
    while True :
        print "Thread with ID %d has counter value %d"% (id, count)
        time.sleep(2)
        count += 1

for i in range(5) : 
    thread.start_new_thread(worker_thread, (i,))

print "Main thread going for a infitie wait loop"
while True :
    pass
```

## Threading and Queues
* Create task queues
* Threads receive tasks
* Threads complete tasks and inform queues
* All threads exit conce queue is empty

### Example

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

import threading
import Queue
import time

class WorkerThread(threading.Thread) :

    def __init__(self, queue) :
        threading.Thread.__init__(self)
        self.queue = queue

    def run(self) :
        print "In Worker Thread"
        while True :
            counter = self.queue.get()
            print "Ordered to sleep for %d"%counter
            time.sleep(counter)
            print "Finished sleeping for %d"%counter
            self.queue.task_done()

queue = Queue.Queue()

for i in range(10) :
    print "Creating Worker Thread : %d"%i
    worker = WorkerThread(queue)
    worker.setDaemon(True)
    worker.start()
    print "Worker Thread %d Created!"%i

for j in range (10) :
    queue.put(j)

queue.join()

print "All tasks ovver!"
```
