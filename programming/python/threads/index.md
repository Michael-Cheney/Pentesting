# Threads
CPython implementation detail: Due to the Global interpreter Lock, in CPython only one thread can execute Python code at once (even though certain performance-oriented libraries might overcome this limitation). If you want your application to make better use of the computational resources of multi-core machines, yyou are advised to use multiprocessing. However, threading is still an appropriate model if you want to run multiple I/O-bound tasks simultaneously. 

* Apart from I/O Tasks such as Network reads, Writing to disk etc. Python Threads are not too useful. 
* Simple threads using the thread module
* More complicated ones using the threading module

## Example
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

import thread
import time

def worder_thread(id) :
    
    print "Thread ID %d now alive"%id
    count = 1
    while True :
        print "Thread with ID %d has counter value %d"% (id, count)
        time.sleep(2)
        count += 1

for i in range(5) : 
    thread.start_new_thread(worker_thread, (i,))

print "Main thread going for a infitie wait loop"
while True :
    pass
```
