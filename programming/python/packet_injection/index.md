# Packet Injection
* Ability to inject raw packets into the network
* Powerful as we can simulate responses from the network
* Packet construction not scalable with raw sockets
* If you can inject random data in the network
  * You know you can send anything

## Example
```python
import socket
import struct

#
rawSocket = socket.socket(socketPF_PACKET, socket.SOCK_RAW, sockethtons(0x0800))
# Bind to ETH0 in IP format
rawSocket.bind(("eth0", socket.htons(0x0800)))

# Create package Destination, Source, Protocol (IP)
packet = struct.pack("!6s6s2s", '\xaa\xaa\xaa\xaa\xaa\xaa', '\xbb\xbb\xbb\xbb\xbb\xbb', '\x08\x00') 
# Send the actual packet
rawSocket.send(packet + "Hello there")

```
