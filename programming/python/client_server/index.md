# Client - Server
## Socket Programming
* TCP and UDP Sockets
  * Regular servers and clients
* Raw Sockets
  * Sniffing and injection

## Socket Module
### Example
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

import socket

# Define a socket
tcpSocket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
# This option recovers the port after a crash and doesn't leave it open. 
tcpSocket.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
# Bind to an address and port
tcpSocket.bind(("0.0.0.0", 8000))
# Listen on the socket, 2 is the number of concurrent clients
tcpSocket.listen(2)
# Wait for client connections
(client, ( ip, sock)) = tcpSocket.accept()
# Client returns client socket details
client
# ip returns client ip address
ip
# port returns client port
port
# Send data to a client
client.send("This is a test message")
# Receive data from the client (Set a variable to collect the data)
data = client.recv(2048)
# View the data
data
```
### Example Echo server
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

import socket

tcpSocket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

tcpSocket.bind(("0.0.0.0", 8000))

tcpSocket.listen(2)

print "Waiting for a Client..."
(client, ( ip, sock)) = tcpSocket.accept()

print "Received connection from : ", ip

print "Starting ECHO output"

data = 'dummy'

while len(data) :

    data = client.recv(2048)
    print "Client sent: ",data
    client.send(data)

print "Closing connection..."
client.close()

print "Shutting down server..."
tcpSocket.close()
```

## Process Client Options
* Process clients sequentially and one at a time
* Multi-Threaded server
* Multi-Process server
* Non-Blocking Sockets with Select (Multiplexing)
