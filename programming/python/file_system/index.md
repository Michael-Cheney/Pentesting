# File I/O  in Python
* `open(file_name, access_mode, buffering)`
* `read(byte_count)`
* `write(data)`
* `close()`
* `os.rename() os.delete()`

## Example
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
# Open File as writeable if it doesn't exist it will be created
fdesc = open("text.txt", "w",)
# Append to a file
fdesc = open("test.txt", "a")
# Read a file
fdesc = open("test.txt", "r")
# Print each line in a file and strip the \n that print adds
for line in fdesc.readlines() :
    print line.strip()
# Write to File
for count in range(0,100)
    fdesc.write(str(count) + "\n")
# Close the file
fdesc.close()
```

## Example Rename a file
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

import os

os.rename("text.txt", "test_renamed.txt")
```
