# Signals
* Allows handling of Asynchronous events
* SIGKILL is what get sent when you use "kill -9"
* Programming with Signals is easy
## Example
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

import signal

def ctrlc_handler(signum, frm) :

    print "Haha! You cannot kill me!"

print "Installing signal handler..."
signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, ctrlc_handler)

print "Done'

while True: 
    pass
```
