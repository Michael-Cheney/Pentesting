There is an FTP server that is available anonymously. The FTP server contains a bunch of zip files. We can crack the zip file named tom.zip and use the ssh key contained inside to ssh into the server. Tom is also restricted to an rbash profile so we need to use the "bash --noprofile" command to bypass that.

Commands
```bash
ftp $ip
ls
get tom.zip
quit
```
