## SED

| Description | Flags |

| To add a script/command that needs to be executed with the pattern/script(on searching for pattern) | `-e` |
| Specify the file containing string pattern | `-f` |
| Use extended regular expressions | `-E` |
| Suppress the automatic printing or pattern spacing | `-n` |

| Description | Commands |
|:------------|:---------|
| (Most used)Substitute mode (find and replace mode) | `s` |
| Works same as substitution; the only difference is, it works on individual bytes in the string provided(this mode takes no arguments/conditions) |  `y` |

| Description | Flags/Args |
| globally(any pattern change will be affected globally, i.e. throughout the text; generally works with s mode) | `/g ` |
| To make the pattern search case-insensitive(can be combined with other flags) | `/i` |
| To delete the pattern found(Deletes the whole line; takes no parameter like conditions/modes/to-be-replaced string) | `/d` |
| prints the matching pattern(a duplicate will occur in output if not suppressed with -n flag.) | `/p` |
