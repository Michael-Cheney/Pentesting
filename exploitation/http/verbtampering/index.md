# HTTP Verb Tampering
## Verb Types
| Info | Command | 
|:-------|:--------|
| HEAD    | Identical to a GET request, but its response only contains the headers, without the response body |
| PUT     | Writes the request payload to the specified location |
| DELETE  | Deletes the resource at the specified location |
| OPTIONS | Shows different options accepted by a web server, like accepted HTTP verbs |
| PATCH   | Apply partial modifications to the resource at the specified location |

## Insecure Configurations
Although the below method specifies both GET & POST require authentication an attacker may still use a different HTTP method to pybass this authentication mechanism. 

```xml
<Limit GET POST>
    Require valid-user
</Limit>
```
## Insecure Coding
The below would only filter against the GET method. 
```php
$pattern = "/^[A-Za-z\s]+$/";

if(preg_match($pattern, $_GET["code"])) {
    $query = "Select * from ports where port_code like '%" . $_REQUEST["code"] . "%'";
    ...SNIP...
}
```

## Check what options are available
`curl -i -X OPTIONS http://SERVER_IP:PORT/`
