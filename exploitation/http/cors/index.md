# Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)
## What is CORS
Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a browser mechanism which enables controlled access to resources located outside of a given domain. It extends and adds flexibility to the same-origin policy (SOP). However, it also provides potential for cross-domain attacks, if a website's CORS policy is poorly configured and implemented. CORS is not a protection against cross-orogin attacks such as cross-site request forgery (CSRF). 

## Same-origin policy
The same-origin policy is a restrictive cross-origin specification that limits the ability for a website to interact with resources outside of the source domain. The same-origin policy was defined mmany years ago in response to potentially malicious cross-domain interactions, such as one website stealing private data from another. It generally allows a domain to issue request to other domains, but not to access the responses.
