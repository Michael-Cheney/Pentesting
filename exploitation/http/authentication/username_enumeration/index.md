# Username Enumeration
## Status Codes
During a brute-force attack, the returned HTTP status code is likely to be the same for the vast majority of guesses because most of them will be wrong. If a guess returns a different status code, this is a strong indication that thhe  username was correct. It is best practice for websites to always return the same status code regardless of the outcome, but this practice is not always followed. 
## Error Messages
Sometimes the returned error message is different depending on whether both the username AND password are incorrect or only the password was incorrect. It is best practice for websites to use identical, generic messages in both cases, but small typing errors sometimes creep in. Just one character out of place makes the two messages distinct, even in cases where the character is not visible on the rendered page. 
## Response Times
If most of the requests were handled with a similar response time, any that deviate from this suggest that something different was happening behing the scenes. this is another indication that the guessed username might be correct. For example, a website might only check whether the password is correct if the username is valid. This extra step might cause a slight increase in the response time. this may6 be subtle, but an attacker can make this delay moroe obvious by entering an excessively long password that the website takes noticeable longer to handle.
