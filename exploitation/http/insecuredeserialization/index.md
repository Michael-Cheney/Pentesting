# Insecure deserialization
## How to identify
### PHP
PHP uses a mostly human-readable string format, with letters representing the data type and numbers representing the length of each entry. For example, consider a User object with the attributes:

`$user->name = "carlos";`
`$user->isLoggedIn = true; `

When serialized, this object may look something like this:

`O:4:"User":2:{s:4:"name":s:6:"carlos"; s:10:"isLoggedIn":b:1;} `

This can be interpreted as follows:

* O:4:"User" - An object with the 4-character class name "User"
* 2 - the object has 2 attributes
* s:4:"name" - The key of the first attribute is the 4-character string "name"
* s:6:"carlos" - The value of the first attribute is the 6-character string "carlos"
* s:10:"isLoggedIn" - The key of the second attribute is the 10-character string "isLoggedIn"
* b:1 - The value of the second attribute is the boolean value true

The native methods for PHP serialization are `serialize()` and `unserialize()`. If you have source code access, you should start by looking for unserialize() anywhere in the code and investigating further. 

### Java
Some languages, such as Java, use binary serialization formats. This is more difficult to read, but you can still identify serialized data if you know how to recognize a few tell-tale signs. For example, serialized Java objects always begin with the same bytes, which are encoded as `ac ed` in hexadecimal and `rO0` in Base64.

Any class that implements the interface `java.io.Serializable` can be serialized and deserialized. If you have source code access, take note of any code that uses the `readObject()` method, which is used to read and deserialize data from an `InputStream`.
