# Insecure Direct Object Reference
## What is IDOR? 
Insecure Direct Object Reference occur when an application provides direct access to objects based on user-supplied input. This will allow a malicious attacker to access data belonging to other users by manipulating the request.

## Example
Original URL
http://example.com/api/user/167865/address

Response:
```json
{
    "id";167865,
    "username";"testuser",
    "address";"1 high street"
}
```
Modified URL
http://example.com/api/user/1/address

Response:
```json
{
    "id";1,
    "username";"admin",
    "address";"1 admin street"
}
```
