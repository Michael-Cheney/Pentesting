## API1:2019 Broken Object Level Authorization
### Based on user ID

`https://google.com/get_users_search_history?userID=1234`

**Safe code example**
```java
if($_GET['userID'] === object.ownerID){
  ShowData()
}else{
  echo "You are not allowed to view this data"
  wait(5s)
  Redirect(Homepage)
}
```
**Unsafe code example**
```java
if(!$_GET['userID'] === object.ownerID){
  echo "You are not allowed to view this data"
  wait(5s)
  Redirect(Homepage)
}
ShowData()
```
### Based on object ID

## A1 - Broken level authorization
## A2 - Broken authentication
### An API is vulnerable if it:
* Permits credential stuffing whereby the attacker has a list of valid usernames and passwords.
* Permits attackers to perform a brute force attack on the same user account, without presenting captcha/account lockout mechanism.
* Permits weak passwords.
* Sends sensitive authentication details, such as auth tokens and passwords in the URL.
* Doesn’t validate the authenticity of tokens.
* Accepts unsigned/weakly signed JWT tokens ("alg":"none")/doesn’t validate their expiration date.
* Uses plain text, non-encrypted, or weakly hashed passwords.
* Uses weak encryption keys.

### How to test
1. Perform brute force attack
2. Attempt to configure a weak password
3. Check for sensitive authentication details, such as auth tokens and passwords in the URL
4. Create an invalid token to ensure tokens are in fact being validated
5.
