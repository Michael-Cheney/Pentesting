# Operating System and Programming Theory
## Programming Theory
### Programming Language Level
### Programming Concepts
**class** - acts as a template for creating objects. Most classes contain a number of variables to store associated data and methods that can perform actions on the variables.


In the Object-oriented paradigm, an object is instantiated from its class through a special method called constructor. Typically the constructor is named after its class and itâ€™s mostly used to setup and initialize the instance variables of a class.


```csharp
public class MyClass
{
    private int myNumber;
    
    // constructor
    public MyClass(int aNumber)
    {
        this.myNumber = aNumber;
    }
    
    public getNumber()
    {
    return myNumber;
    }
}
```

## Windows Concepts
### Windows On Windows
### Win32 APIs

Function prototype for GetUserNameA (ASCII version of the API)
```csharp
BOOL GetUserNameA(
    LPSTR lpBuffer,
    LPDWORD pcbBuffer
);
```

Function prototype for GetUserNameA (Unicode version of the API W for "wide char")
```csharp
BOOL GetUserNameW(
    LPWSTR lpBuffer,
    LPDWORD pcbBuffer
);
```

### Windows Registry
HKEY_CURRENT_USER (HKCU) - Current User
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE (HKLM) - Local Machine

The HKEY_CURRENT_USER hive is writable by the current user while
modification of the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE hive requires administrative
privileges.
